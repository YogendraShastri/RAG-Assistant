The\nfollowing tips tell you how to avoid accidents in suchconditions :\nzDrive slowly : Low driving speed increases the surfaceof tyre tread in contact with the road and provides bettertraction. zMaintain safe distances from other vehicles : Wet weatherresults in longer stopping (about four times that ofnormal stopping distance). So, it make sense to keep agood distance from other vehicles, people and objectson you path. zMaintain tyres : Tyres do not provide adequate tractiononce the tread wears below two thirds of the tread depth.Check tyres regularly and replace them atappropriateintervals.. Maintain the recommended tyre pressure in thetyres at all times. zWhile braking, accelerating or turning, avoid jerky andabrupt movements\nApply smooth, even pressure on all controls. Abrupt steering\nwheel movements or sudden, hard application of brakes cancause loss of control.
