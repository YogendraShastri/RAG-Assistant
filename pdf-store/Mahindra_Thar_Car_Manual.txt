RRRRRGear Shifting
(26)Mahindra THARMud, Snow & Sand
Shift to 4WDH range first gear when traversing without load.
Do not shift into any lower gear than is necessary to maintainheadway. Tyre pressure may be reduced by about 0.7 kg/cm2 (10 psi), if additional floatation is required.Up hillShift to 4WDL range, second gear. Drop down to first gear
only when the steepness of the ascent requires the lower gearto maintain headway.NoteOver-reving the engine will cause the wheels to start spinning& traction will be lost.Getting over the HumpIf the wheels start to slip with only a few feet of the ascentremaining, headway may be maintained by swinging the frontwheels sharply left & right. This will provide a fresh 'bite' intothe surface & will usually result in enough traction tocomplete the climb.StallIf the vehicle stalls or loses headway when climbing asteephill, make a fast shift to reverse or first gear. Do notdepress the clutch. Engine compression will hold the vehicleon the hill. Do not try to back down with the clutch released& only the brakes holding the vehicle. By shifting to reverse,
it is possible to start the engine without depressing clutch.Let the vehicle move backward with the starter. When enginestarts, control the downward speed with the accelerator.Down hillShift to 4WD range, first gear. Do not use clutch & brakes.
Now the vehicle can proceed safely down a grade slowly withall 4 wheels turning against engine compression.Caution
zAs soon as the vehicle finishes, its traversing through thehubs in sand, mud or water, clean the brake drums fromforeign abrasive materials sticking to it to avoid thewearing of brake linings.
zWhen negotiating across slopes or hill, choose as mildan angle as possible (keep moving & make turns quickly).Do not travel diagonally across a hill unless absolutelynecessary.
zFor normal driving on hard surfaced roads, 4WD shouldnot be used.
zTo relieve the build up of torsional stresses, due toprolonged use of 4WD on hard surface roads, simply drivethe vehicle in reverse for several feet or drive off hardsurface momentary to allow tyres to slip.Gear Shifting -  4 WD
(27) Mahindra THARDriving in Wet Weather / Snowy Conditions
Wet weather or snow can be dangerous for driving. The
following tips tell you how to avoid accidents in suchconditions :
zDrive slowly : Low driving speed increases the surfaceof tyre tread in contact with the road and provides bettertraction.
zMaintain safe distances from other vehicles : Wet weatherresults in longer stopping (about four times that ofnormal stopping distance). So, it make sense to keep agood distance from other vehicles, people and objectson you path.
zMaintain tyres : Tyres do not provide adequate tractiononce the tread wears below two thirds of the tread depth.Check tyres regularly and replace them atappropriateintervals.. Maintain the recommended tyre pressure in thetyres at all times.
zWhile braking, accelerating or turning, avoid jerky andabrupt movements
Apply smooth, even pressure on all controls. Abrupt steering
wheel movements or sudden, hard application of brakes cancause loss of control.
Driving Tips
(28) Mahindra THARDriving Tips
zExercise extra caution while driving in rain after a long
dry spell. After months of dry weather, the first rainsbring grime to the surface of the roads, making itslippery.
zWhile driving on wet surfaces, downshift carefully. If thetraction is low it can lock up the drive wheels for amoment and cause a skid.
Driving in Low Visibility
Being able to see clearly in all directions and being visibleto other drivers is important in all weather conditions. Thisis more difficult in bad weather conditions.To be seen moreclearly during daylight hours, turn the headlights ON. Inspectthe windshield wipers and washers regularly. Keep thewindshield washer reservoir full. If the windshield wiperblades start to streak the windshield or leave parts unwiped.replace them. Use the defroster to avoid fogging or windshieldon the inside.

Topping up the Engine OilThe engine oil level should be maintained at little below  high
mark on the dipstick & must never be allowed to fall belowthe low. While checking the oil level, park the vehicle on a
level ground with the engine shut down. Withdraw the dipstickfrom its holder, clean & refit. Withdraw again & note the level.Top-up as required with the clean correct grade of engine oil.Always drain & fill the oil when engine is warm.Note -  Start the engine, run at a fast idling speed for about
a minute. Stop the engine & after allowing some time oillevel to stabilize, recheck again & top-up if necessary.
zDo not mix different brands or grades of oil.
zLubricating oil filter should be replaced at everyoil change.
Use oil grade as per lubrication chart for ambient up to -
5
0C. At lower temperature, use oil of lower viscocity grade.
(37) Mahindra THARThe air filter is located on the Right Hand (RH) side of
the engine compartment. A dry type air filter is used. Airfilter service indicator (SI) is fitted on the hose betweenthe air filter and engine. This service indicator has to bechecked at every 5000 km. to confirm that red band doesnot appear on service indicator. Whenever red bandappears, it means that the air filter element is choked upand needs servicing. Clogged air filter leads to higher intakeresistance and can reduce the driveability of the vehicle.Servicing Instructions :
